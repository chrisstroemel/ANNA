# Attentive Neural Network Architecture
#### Note: not quite finished yet
ANNA is an attempt to make neural reinforcement learning efficient and scalable.  ANNA is unique in that doesn't use backpropagation, and is instead based on a [probabilistic graphical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model).
